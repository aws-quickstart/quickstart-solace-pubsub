## Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker version 8.7 or later on the AWS Cloud in a highly available (HA) cluster.

The Solace message broker is an implementation of the Solace SolOS messaging technology that runs on general-purpose processors in data centers, developersâ€™ laptops, Internet of Things (IoT) gateways, the cloud, and other enterprise environments.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy a fully configured Solace PubSub+ message broker HA cluster in your AWS account. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying the Solace message broker cluster into a new VPC
- Deploying the Solace message broker cluster into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
