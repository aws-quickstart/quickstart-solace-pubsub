## Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR) version 8.7 or later on the AWS Cloud in a highly available (HA) cluster.

The Solace VMR is an implementation of the Solace SolOS messaging technology that runs on general-purpose processors in data centers, developersâ€™ laptops, Internet of Things (IoT) gateways, the cloud, and other enterprise environments.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy a fully configured Solace VMR HA cluster in your AWS account. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying the VMR cluster into a new VPC
- Deploying the VMR cluster into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
